# Testing
Describe testing on Capstone project


## Unit Testing

Our project is mainly front end development. We have done very little on the backend. Most of our unit testing has been to open the webpage and view the results. The team is working on writing formal unit tests, but up to this point they have mostly been viewing things on the front end webpage. This has been done as we complete each phase of our project. When we were working on making the course card, we made sure that it could be pulled up and looked correct before we moved on to embedding in the webpage. Then, when we were working on how the card looked on the webpage, we tried vertical and horizontal layout and light and dark mode before embedding those in the webpage. We did this throughout the creation of the webpage so that we could evaluate each component before putting them all together.

## System testing

Again, since our project is mainly a frontend one, we did system tests by running through and navigating the webpage. We made the builder widget, and we made sure that it was interactive with the user. Given certain inputs, it creates an iFrame tag that the user can then copy and paste to their page. We made sure that when certain buttons are pushed that the Builder adds them to the tag. We basically test the system by making sure that each component is responding the way that we expect it to. We also make sure that each component works well with the other components.

## Acceptance testing

Our acceptance tests would likely be performance tests. First, we need to make sure that our team approves of the final product and accepts that it does what we want it to. Next, NextThought would have to test through and see if what we implmented fits their idea of the project. Of course, lastly, we would see if the project performs correctly for the NextThought's client.
